# KahootPinFinder

This script will allow you to find working pin for Kahoot game. 

Blue and green code are the one having the most chance to work, while yellow and orange are pretty unlikely to work. But hey, you never know.
Red code won't work in almost every case (except if someone is doing a kahoot for 3 hours straight lol).

Sorry if the code is not optimized...
